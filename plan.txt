Plan thus far:

1. Write code to generate a huffman tree
2. Write code to take a file and feed it to (1).
	- ideas include:
		- making a dictionary of size 256 (all chars)
		  where the pairs are (char, frequency)
3. Figure out how best to encode the tree itself
4. Code up Stan's code to output bits (modified of course)
5. Write code to decode the huffman tree and accept bit stream.
6. Add error correction to the huffman code somehow.
